The code is based on Scikit-Learn iForest code.

To run iForest:
	python iForest.py <in_file> <out_file> <num_runs> <number_of_trees>
	
	
An example:
	python iForest.py ../../Data/sample_data.txt ../../Sample_Output/IF_sample_data 10 100
	
will produce the following files:
	../../Sample_Output/IF_sample_data - each line contains information for the run - runId <tab> AUC <tab> AP
	and last line contains MeanAUC, StdDev AUC, Mean AP, StdDev AP
	../../Sample_Output/IF_sample_data.pkl - contains the scores of the data
