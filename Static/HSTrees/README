The code is based on Shubhmoy Das' code available here:

Depending on the dataset, HSTrees code can take some time.
To check the code in a quick manner - we will recommend doing it only for 1 run, 
or doing multiple runs with less number of trees, say 10.

To run HS-Trees:
	python HSTree_runner.py <in_file> <out_file> <num_runs> <number_of_trees> <max_depth>
	
	
An example:
	python HSTree_runner.py ../../Data/sample_data.txt ../../Sample_Output/HST_sample_data 1 100 15
	
will produce the following files:
	../../Sample_Output/HST_sample_data - contains information MeanAUC, StdDev AUC, Mean AP, StdDev AP
	../../Sample_Output/HST_sample_data.pkl - contains the scores of the data
