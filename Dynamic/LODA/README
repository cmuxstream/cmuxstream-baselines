streamLoda_dd.m - Works well for smaller datasets; and is in original format as given by Tomas Pevny.
To run streamLoda_mod.m:
	[yHat] = stream_loda_mod(X,y,winSize,sparsity,histType,maxBins,op_file)

PARAMETERS:
	1. X: The input data.
	2. y: Label
	3. winSize: Window Size (set to 256)
	4. sparsity: 'sparse'/'dense'
