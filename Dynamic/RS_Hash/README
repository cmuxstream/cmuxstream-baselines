The code is based on RS-Hash paper: http://saketsathe.net/downloads/rshash.pdf

For streaming setting, we use the exact hash variant. Therefore the number of hash functions is just 1 i.e. a dictionary. 
For each component, a dictionary is maintained.
The number of sampling points is set to 1000

To run RSHash:
	python sparse_stream_RSHash.py <in_file> <out_file> <decay>
	
An example:
	python sparse_stream_RSHash.py ../../Data/http10K.csv ../../Sample_Output/Stream_RSH_http10k.txt 0.015
